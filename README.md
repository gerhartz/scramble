Scramble (Apple Store: USA 14ers) is an Ionic / Angular / Firebase app that helps you discover 14er mountain climbing routes and point you in the direction of additional planning resources. It's curated content that's easily searchable based on state, climbing class and trailhead access.

PROBLEM: As a rookie mountaineer, I've found that it can be very time consuming to browse online for information about climbing mountains. Information is split across multiple sources each with their own popups, logins, meandering trail report stories, missing info and more that can make it painful to just get the basic route info you need to make a decision -- location, class, and whether your car can actually make it to the trailhead.

SOLUTION: Scramble makes it easy to discover routes and link to relevant planning resources and track progress along the way. Scramble contains all the relevant info about routes -- elevation gain, class, trailhead access, location -- and makes it easy to filter and find routes based on your specific needs and has links to websites and guidebooks to take the next step in planning the climb. Find mountains and routes that suit your needs in minutes, not hours.

FEATURES:
- Search for mountains that can be climbed based on State, Class and Trailhead Access
